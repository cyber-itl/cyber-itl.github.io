Many attacks involve hijacking software execution, so that the attacker can direct the computer to a different code path than originally intended.  Sometimes this is to get their own code executed, and other times they're trying to cobble together a new effect from snippets of existing code, sort of like someone writing a ransom note by cutting out words from a magazine.  CFI is available in some form on most modern desktop systems, but is implemented differently on each.</dd>

Commercial code doesn't have to live up to the same standards as the code in the space shuttle, but programmers should still try to "Keep it Simple, Stupid." We measure a few different characteristics of the code in order to assess complexity, and we highlight cases where the complexity is significantly different than average. This includes the sizes, numbers, and scores of the libraries code uses, as well as the overall code size.</dd>

It is dangerous for a part of memory where user input resides to be marked as code, because this allows the user to potentially introduce and run their own code.

                            Instead of writing code from scratch, sometimes a developer will use functions or modules from code that someone else already wrote. This way, they aren't "reinventing the wheel" if someone else has already written and shared the code they need. These software projects obtained from third parties are called libraries.

                            <br /><br /> Vulnerabilities inside libraries frequently have higher overall impact then vulnerabilities within proprietary code, because the same library could be used by many different applications. For example, Heartbleed was a problem within a commonly used library.
