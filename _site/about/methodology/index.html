            <h3>“How difficult is it for an attacker to find a new exploit for this software?”</h3>
            <p>Attackers have limited resources, and just like anyone else, they don't like to waste their time doing something the hard way if an easier path is available. They have tricks and heuristics they use to assess the relative difficulty to exploit software, so that they can focus on the easy targets and low hanging fruit. Mudge has had a long career of doing just that (legally, and for research purposes), so he's developed his own personal toolkit of measurements to take when assessing software risk. By consulting with other luminaries of the security field who have extensive exploit development experience, we've been able to build up the list of static analysis metrics and features which we currently assess.</p>

            <p class="width-small">Our current score weightings heavily emphasize safety features and function hygiene. The safety features in particular are the easiest issues to fix, and are the most fundamental. When the software industry has gotten to a point where these are included as a matter of course, we will adjust our score weightings to place  a greater emphasis on more subtle elements like complexity. The way we think of it is, if a house’s front door is unlocked, we’re not going to worry too much about getting shatter sensors installed in the windows. Vendors need to get the basics in place first, and then we’ll move our focus to the next thing which can move the overall quality of software forward. If you happen to have those basics in place in your own products, however, and want to know what we’ll be focusing on in the future, look to the complexity and dynamic testing measurements. </p>

These features are to software what airbags and seatbelts are to cars: things that are known and proven to improve safety, and whose use should be established by now as industry-standard. If your car doesn't have airbags, you're entitled to know that before you buy it.</p>

                            <p>More complex code is harder to review and maintain, and is more likely to contain bugs.  This is why NASA/JPL put limits on things like function size for code that's going into critical systems. Commercial code doesn't have to live up to the same standards as the code in the space shuttle, but programmers should still try to "Keep it Simple, Stupid." We measure a few different characteristics of the code in order to assess complexity, and we highlight cases where the complexity is significantly different than average. This includes the sizes, numbers, and scores of the libraries code uses, as well as the overall code size.</p>

                            <p>Currently code size is not factored into our total scores, as we are focusing on the lower hanging fruit found in Safety Features and Code Hygiene. We provide code complexity measure as a third way for consumers to compare their software.</p>

            <h2>Crash Testing</h2>
            <p class="width-small">The most commonly accepted method of testing software today is crash testing, or fuzzing. Software is given malformed inputs, to see if and how it crashes. You can learn a lot about how something is built from how it breaks, and fuzzing provides a lot of insight into how robust or potentially exploitable software is.</p>

            <h2>Data Sources</h2>
            <p class="width-small">Most of the software we test is obtained the same way any consumer would get it – by buying it. This ensures that the software we test is the same as the software that end users have access to.  We also get some software through publicly available sources, in the case of open source products, or where IoT firmware is available for download. Some IoT software we extract directly off of the IoT products, and in other cases we obtain software through partnerships with other non-profit and research entities. We never get software to test through private relationships with the vendors whose products we’re evaluating. </p>

            <h2>Analysis Tools</h2>
            <p class="width-small">
                Our security evaluations are performed using a combination of proprietary and publicly-available software analysis tools, employing both static and dynamic methods of analysis. These tools are used to examine the features described elsewhere on this page: code hygiene, build safety features, and crash testing.
            </p>
            <p class="width-small">
                The publicly-available tools in our toolchest are all well-known in the software analysis community. However, in the interest of encouraging vendors to go above-and-beyond the bare minimum, we do not publicly disclose what these tools are. Instead, we advise vendors to perform their own thorough evaluations of their products prior to release, using a wide variety of different analysis tools.
            </p>
            <p class="width-small">
                Though we use publicly-available tools whenever possible, certain aspects of our mission have motivated us to develop some proprietary tools as well. These tools are designed to serve our organization's peculiar needs, most notably, the ability to perform cross-platform software analysis, and the ability to collect detailed debug and tracing data for use in our scientific efforts. Analytically, these tools perform functions which can largely be found in publicly-available alternatives. They also perform functions which are relevant to our scientific efforts, but which have not yet been incorporated into our general reporting.
