<p>So, first off, thank you! &nbsp;We've been thrilled so far by the media coverage and security community reaction we received.<!--more--> &nbsp;It was particularly exciting to hear people in other Defcon and Black Hat talks speculating on how our efforts could be used to inform/support/feed into theirs (<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602104/how-public-shame-might-force-a-revolution-in-computer-security/">Thanks, Jeremiah!</a>). &nbsp;While our main reports and content will be tailored to a broader audience, we definitely want our data to be a tool that the security researcher community can make use of. &nbsp;We also think that this detailed data will be extremely useful to the insurance industry as actuarial data to inform their cyber insurance practices.</p><p>We try to keep our <a href="/news/press">Press page</a> up to date with the latest media mentions, but if that's one click too many for you, we've had great coverage lately in <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/07/29/a-famed-hacker-is-grading-thousands-of-programs-and-may-revolutionize-software-in-the-process/">The Intercept</a>,&nbsp;on <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-ratings-idUSKCN10D2EO/">Reuters</a>, and in <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602104/how-public-shame-might-force-a-revolution-in-computer-security/">MIT Tech Review</a>. &nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/intoverflow?lang=en">Tim Carstens</a> did a perfect job of succinctly explaining what CITL is all about:</p>

<p>When the Black Hat and Defcon talks become available on Youtube we'll post links, and we'll be posting a lot of the charts and data from those talks here in the coming weeks. &nbsp;We aren't posting the slides themselves, as we don't like to have slides distributed without the voice track that goes along with them - it's too easy to take things out of context, especially given that our current data is not a finalized product. &nbsp;We expect to start releasing reports to the public near the end of this year, with things continuing to ramp up in 2017.</p><p>So, stay tuned for more CITL goodness!</p>
