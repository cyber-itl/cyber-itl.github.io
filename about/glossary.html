                        <dd>Attackers will try to piece existing computer code together to make the system do what they want, like using words out of different magazines to write a ransom note. If each application's code is loaded at a predictable location, this is pretty easy to do, so modern operating systems randomize the locations of code segments. To follow our metaphor, if the attacker doesn't know which words are where, they can't write the message they want to write in their note.</dd>

                        <dd>Control Flow Integrity (CFI) is one of the newest safety features to be added to Windows, and refers to any safety features that try to prevent attackers from redirecting the path of code execution. Many attacks involve hijacking software execution, so that the attacker can direct the computer to a different code path than originally intended.  Sometimes this is to get their own code executed, and other times they're trying to cobble together a new effect from snippets of existing code, sort of like someone writing a ransom note by cutting out words from a magazine.  CFI is available in some form on most modern desktop systems, but is implemented differently on each.</dd>

                        <dd>More complex code is harder to review and maintain, and is more likely to contain bugs.  This is why NASA/JPL put limits on things like function size for code that's going into critical systems. Commercial code doesn't have to live up to the same standards as the code in the space shuttle, but programmers should still try to "Keep it Simple, Stupid." We measure a few different characteristics of the code in order to assess complexity, and we highlight cases where the complexity is significantly different than average. This includes the sizes, numbers, and scores of the libraries code uses, as well as the overall code size.</dd>

                        <dd>There are things we can learn about a developer's security skill and knowledge based on what functions are used in the code they write. We evaluate about 500 functions that fall into these categories, and by looking at the frequency, count, and consistency of the function used we can learn a lot about the developer practices of a particular software vendor.</dd>

                        <dd>A software application mostly consists code sections and data sections. Code is the instructions that tell the computer what to do, and the data is the information the computer needs in order to follow those instructions. The total size of all code sections is the code size.</dd>

                        <dd>The most commonly accepted method of testing software today is crash testing, or fuzzing. Software is given malformed inputs, to see if and how it crashes. You can learn a lot about how something is built from how it breaks, and fuzzing provides a lot of insight into how robust or potentially exploitable software is. </dd>

                        <dd>DEP tries to make sure attacker introduced data is not treated as executable instructions by the computer. Some operating systems have separate application armoring settings for Stack DEP and Heap DEP, while others pretext both with a single setting. The stack and the heap are the two locations where data is stored by the application.</dd>

                        <dd>
                            When used a noun, an executable is a file that can be run by a computer program. A large application, like a browser or a word processor, usually consists of many executable files, with one main one that interconnects with all the rest.
                            <br /><br />When used as an adjective, "executable" indicates that a particular part of the computer's memory has been identified as being code/instructions to be run, not data/user input. It is dangerous for a part of memory where user input resides to be marked as code, because this allows the user to potentially introduce and run their own code.

In many cases,  safer, alternative versions of these functions exist, but programmers still frequently use the original, less safe versions.  If fortification is enabled, then the compiler will try to replace these functions with safer versions. If the compiler can't figure out how to do a replacement correctly, it won't change anything, so the use of fortification doesn't guarantee that *all* unsafe functions get fortified.</dd>

                            Instead of writing code from scratch, sometimes a developer will use functions or modules from code that someone else already wrote. This way, they aren't "reinventing the wheel" if someone else has already written and shared the code they need. These software projects obtained from third parties are called libraries.

                            <br /><br /> Vulnerabilities inside libraries frequently have higher overall impact then vulnerabilities within proprietary code, because the same library could be used by many different applications. For example, Heartbleed was a problem within a commonly used library.

"Source" in this case refers to source code (link to other definition). When code is proprietary and not available for review or download, that is called closed source. Most commercial products are closed source.
